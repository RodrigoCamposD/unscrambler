# Unscrambler

The idea of this simple project is to find a "real" word with a given other scrambled word. You can run this in your local machine browser without need of a server (CORS).

You can add your own dict, just update the file "words.js

```
export const dicts = {
  ptBR: ["word1", "word2"],
  enUS: ["word3", "word4"],
};
```

No need to be upper case, just remember to use languages name like "enUS"
